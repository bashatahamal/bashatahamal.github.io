summary: Utilization of object recognition for sidewalk safety on roadblock using real time video processing.
describe-opening: This project is a student creativity program (PKM) funded by Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education (DIKTI) by submitting a proposal with an obligation to make a final report. It is a road block like tool on a pedestrian path that utilizes object detection/realtime video processing using camera (Raspberry Pi 3 + Intel Movidius 2) which function to prevent other than pedestrian and cyclist from entering the area. This project was done by three people and the work I did
describe-content:
    - Leader in the team
    - Worked on designing the tool and components needed.
    - Programmer (Python, Intel Movidius NCSDK, Raspberry Pi and others software related).
    - Designing algorithm and tuning pre trained Convolutional Neural Network model for object detection.
