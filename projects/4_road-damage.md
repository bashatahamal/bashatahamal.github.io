summary: Road damage detection with an output of binary image and road damage recognition with an output of bounding box and it's type of class. 
describe-opening: .
describe-content:
    - This project aims to get a model for detecting road damage with an output in the form of a black and white image and a model for detecting and recognizing road damage with the output in the form of a bounding box for each type of class from the available dataset.
    - The model is obtained by comparing the latest methods for each required output type.
    - Model with the output in the form of a black and white image on the pixel where the road damage occurs, the methods used are LinkNet, Unet and FPN with varied backbones Resnet34, InceptionResnetv2, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7 and SEResnext50.
    - Model with a bounding box and it's type of class output, the methods used are Yolov4 and Yolov5.
    - This is a professional project done by one person with one month to complete.
