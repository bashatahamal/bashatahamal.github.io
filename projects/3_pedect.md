summary: Utilization of object recognition for sidewalk safety on roadblocks using real time video processing.
describe-opening: This project is a student creativity program (PKM) funded by Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education (DIKTI) by submitting a proposal and an obligation to make a final report. It is a road block like tool on a pedestrian path that utilizes object detection using camera (Raspberry Pi 3 + Intel Movidius 2) which functions to prevent others than pedestrians and cyclists from entering the area. This is a professional project done by three people and the work I did
