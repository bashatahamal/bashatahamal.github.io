summary: Utilize pedestrian detection for sidewalk safety on roadblocks using realtime video processing.
describe-opening: This project is a student creativity program funded by DIKTI (PKM) by submitting a proposal and an obligation to make a final report. It is a road block like tool on a pedestrian path that utilizes object detection using a camera (Raspberry Pi 3 + Intel Movidius 2) which functions to prevent others than pedestrians and cyclists from entering the area. This is a professional project done by 3 people and the work I did
