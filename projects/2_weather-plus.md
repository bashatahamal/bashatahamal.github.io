summary: Realtime monitoring system for humidity, temperature and dust particle with wireless data logger and automatic rain water sampler.
describe-opening: This project was carried out during practical work at BMKG with the main target of the project is to make a low-cost environmental monitoring tool with a variety of features and combine it with a tool that collects rainwater automatically. The rainwater collector has a cover for the rainwater collection container which only opens when it rains. Environmental condition data collected are air humidity, ambient temperature and dust particles. This project was done by three people and the work I did 
describe-content:
    - Become a leader in technical project completion
    - Build a wireless data logger for data collection and communication tools.
    - Designing and creating a web-based user interface (html, css, ajax, javascript)
    - Designing and making data communication between the tools created with the database on a local wireless computer using wifi (C++, mysql, PHP)
    - Designing the enclosure using acrylic (CorelDraw)
    - Collaborate on hardware programming (ESP32)
