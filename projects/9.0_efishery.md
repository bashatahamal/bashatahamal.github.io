    - AI Research Engineer
summary: Indonesia-based Aquaculture Intelligence Company.
describe-opening: Started in the R&D division conducting AI research and developing foundational LLM applications, and later advanced to AI Squad Lead where I oversaw ML/AI engineering execution, AI platform operations, and team collaboration.

describe-content:
- <strong> AI Research Engineer </strong>
- <em>LLM Applications</em>
- Initiated and led AI research projects on Large Language Models (LLM), starting with functionality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and real-time database integration. The project later became known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHObKce5yFA" target="_blank">Mas Ahya</a>
- Created, engineered, and led the breakthrough development of Mas Ahya (a generative-AI-powered conversational assistant for aquaculture). As the principal engineer of Mas Ahya, I maintained and improved the core system, releasing it for internal farmer use. It was presented at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1D7saqcqYck?t=1334s" target="_blank">Microsoft AI Day</a> by Microsoft CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190961441091239936/" target="_blank">Satya Nadella</a> and featured in various <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/asia/features/to-keep-fish-and-shrimp-healthy-farmers-in-indonesia-now-have-a-copilot-to-help/" target="_blank">news outlets</a> and <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1785196931876368513" target="_blank">social media platforms</a>
- Developed internal LLM application, enabling the internal shrimp team to receive better recommendations on which ponds are ready for harvest via conversational interactions.
- Initiated and led the adoption of LLM-based automated testing and evaluation to strengthen engineering processes, particularly in QA testing and performance assessment of LLM applications.
- Inspired the development of an OCR LLM-based solution that reduced and saved engineering costs.
- Planned LLM Apps MultiAgent systems roadmap and conducted proof of concept (PoC) with capabilities integration with WhatsApp chat non-text media, including voice (text to speech, speech to text), image, and multi-step data confirmation.

- <em>MLOps</em>
- Achieved up to 80% cost reduction in LLM services operations through performance optimization and resource efficiency improvements.
- Led cloud cost analysis, implementing strategies that resulted in up to 60% monthly cost savings through usage optimization.
- Ensured smooth deployment and operational efficiency of AI services.
- Conducted AI service assessments, identifying and addressing areas for cost reduction and performance enhancement.
- Contributed to designing end-to-end Edge Devices and AI roadmap for seamless integration and deployment.


- <strong> AI Squad Leader </strong>
- <em>Squad & Tech Implementation Leadership</em>
- Led ML/AI development driving cross-functional collaboration with engineers, PMs, and stakeholders.
- Managed sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives to ensure efficient Agile execution.
- Oversaw the implementation and maintenance of ML/AI services across AWS, GCP, Azure.
- Enforced code review standards and integrated automated quality control tools for reliability and scalability.
- Ensured seamless ML service deployment across cloud environments.
# - <u> AI Squad Leader </u>
- <em>Technical Council Contribution</em>
- Regular speaker to the Tech Council, a bi-weekly multi-division forum involving VP, engineers, and PMs.
- Critiqued and reviewed technical proposals and implementation strategies to ensure optimal execution.

- <em>Supervised AI Projects</em>
- <u>Optical Character Recognition Solutions</u>
- Automated sensitive data masking for bank statements (BNI, BRI, BCA, CIMB), processing up to 500-page documents with RabbitMQ for efficient workload distribution and manual error reduction.
- OCR enhancement with GPT-4.0, cutting processing time, manual data collection, and engineering costs.
- Document detection and classification for eKYC, utilizing YOLOv8 to optimize ID verification while reducing unnecessary OCR processing costs through manual filtering.
- Custom OCR system with Azure Document Intelligence, replacing third-party services and cutting costs.
