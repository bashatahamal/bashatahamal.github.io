describe-content:
    # - This project aims to get a model for detecting road damage with an output in the form of a black and white image and a model for recognizing road damage with output in the form of bounding box for each type of class from the available dataset.
    # - The model is obtained by comparing the latest methods for each required output type.
    # - Model with output in a form of black and white image on the pixel where the road damage occurs, the method used are LinkNet, Unet and FPN with varied backbones Resnet34, InceptionResnetv2, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7 and SEResnext50.
    # - Model with output in a form of bounding box and it's type of class, the method used are Yolov4 and Yolov5.
    # - This project was carried out by myself with a duration of one month.
    - Developed machine learning models for detecting and classifying road damage using image datasets.
    - Targeted two output types, Pixel-level segmentation producing black-and-white masks highlighting damaged regions and Object detection producing bounding boxes and class labels for each damage type.
    - Evaluated and compared multiple state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including LinkNet, UNet, and FPN, with varied backbones ResNet34, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7, and SEResNeXt50.
    - Implemented object detection using YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 for classification and localization of road damage.
    - Conducted the entire research, experimentation, and model comparison independently within a one-month timeline.
