summary: Traffic monitoring system for counting vehicles and detecting traffic violations.
# describe-opening: <br>Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System is an image processing based software for vehicle counting (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, pedestrians) and traffic violation detection (illegal turn and direction) using video as input via online streaming, video files or camera to get frames image to be processed. This project was completed by two people and the work I did
describe-opening: <br>Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System is an image processing based application for vehicle counting (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, pedestrians) and traffic violation detection, including illegal turns and wrong-way movement. The system processes video input from online streams, video files, or live cameras to perform real-time analysis. This project was developed by a team of two, with the following contributions on my part
describe-content:
    - Became the leader for project completion.
    - Provided technical guidance and practical implementation ideas, including suggested methods, tools, and development workflows.
    - Contributed to dataset creation using low resolution CCTV images for training purposes.
    - Prepared, tuned, and trained the object detection model (YOLOv5) using the constructed dataset.
    - Developed a web-based interface for the system using the Flask framework.
    - Implemented the front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Built the traffic violation detection algorithm by combining video processing techniques with object detection outputs.
describe-closing: <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask, Javascript, HTML/CSS
