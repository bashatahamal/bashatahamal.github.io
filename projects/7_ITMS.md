summary: Traffic monitoring system for counting vehicles and detecting traffic violations.
describe-opening: Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System is an image processing based software for vehicle counting (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, pedestrians) and traffic violation detection (illegal turn and direction) using video as input via online streaming, video files or camera to get frames image to be processed. This project was completed by two people and the work I did
describe-content:
    - Became a leader in project completion.
    - Provide solutions and ideas on how the project can be done, including the methods used.
    - Helped build the dataset using low resolution CCTV images.
    - Worked on preparing, tuning and training the model using the dataset created (Yolov5).
    - Built a web-based user interface for the system using Flask framework.
    - Implemented a web-based interface design with html, css, and javascript.
    - Built the traffic rules violation detection algorithm based on video input and object detection results.
