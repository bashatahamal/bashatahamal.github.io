summary: Document processing using image of Quran verse for recognizing the tajweed rules type and it's location.
describe-opening: This project is the final project of my undergraduate study at Gadjah Mada University majoring in Electronics and Instrumentation, Department of Computer Science and Electronics. The aim of my final project is to develop a method for recognizing the reading law contained in the verses of the Quran with input in the form of images and creating a web-based user interface to display the results. This project consists of the following works
describe-content:
    - Build a dataset of Arabic characters from cropped ​​images of various variations of Arabic letters in 10 types of fonts. Implemented by creating a simple tool for automatic cropping and storage with an UI created using the PySimpleGUI library in python.
    - Perform image processing to be able to get the characteristics of Arabic letters in the image of the Al-Quran verse needed for the purposes of determining the law of reading, including detection of the character marking the occurrence of the reading law by using template matching, compiling algorithms for character segmentation by utilizing image pixel values ​​and perform Arabic character recognition using CNN from the created dataset.
    - Creating a web-based UI using the Flask framework to be able to integrate reading law recognition methods created using python with a user interface created using html, css, and javascript.
