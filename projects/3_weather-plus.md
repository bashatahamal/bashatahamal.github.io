summary: Real-time monitoring system for humidity, ambient temperature and dust particle with wireless data logger and automatic rain water sampler.
describe-opening: This project was carried out during on the job training at Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG). Main objective of this project is to make a low-cost environmental monitoring device with various features and combine it with a tool that collects rainwater automatically. The automatic rainwater collector has a cover for the rainwater collection container which only open when it rains. Environmental condition data collected are air humidity, ambient temperature and dust particles. This project was done by three people and the work I did 
describe-content:
    - Became a leader in technical project completion
    - Built a wireless data logger for data collection and communication tools.
    - Worked on designing and creating a web-based user interface (html, css, ajax, javascript)
    - Worked on designing and making data communication between the device created with the database on a local wireless computer using wifi (C++, mysql, PHP)
    - Worked on designing the enclosure of the tools using acrylic (CorelDraw)
    - Collaborated on hardware programming (ESP32)
