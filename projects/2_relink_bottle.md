summary: Automatic plastic bottle separator based on color using raspberry pi + camera.
# describe-opening: Relink Automatic Plastic Bottle Separator is an actutator tool built using conveyor belt and pneumatic cylinder that being controlled using raspbbery phi + camera to classify whether the plastic bottle is belong to a certain category based on its color. Based on that classification results, the raspberry pi will act as a controller to move the pneumatic cylinder actuator so the plastic bottle that run in the conveyor will be in the desired position. 
describe-opening: Relink Automatic Plastic Bottle Separator is a vision-based sorting system that uses a Raspberry Pi and camera to classify plastic bottles by color. The system controls a conveyor belt and pneumatic cylinder to automatically redirect each bottle into the correct category. Based on the color detected through computer vision, the Raspberry Pi triggers the actuator to position each bottle into its designated output channel.

# describe-closing: The work I did in this project are contribute in writing code, testing, and setting up raspbbery phi to run opencv python that being used as the main controller.
describe-closing: My contributions included writing the core Python/OpenCV code, configuring the Raspberry Pi as the main controller, and performing end-to-end system testing to ensure precise and consistent bottle sorting performance.
